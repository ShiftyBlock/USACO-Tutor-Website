Change the default message displayed on pages/posts which are Password Protected.

== Description ==

Want a simple way to change the message displayed on [Password Protected](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Password_Protection) posts/pages? This plugin will add an option to the "Settings > Reading" page in your dashboard so you can do just that.

"This content is password protected. To view it please enter your password below:" can be changed to any text you prefer.

This plugin will also remove the "Protected" text from the title. So "Protected: Page Title" would become "Page Title".

There may be some themes which are not compatible with this plugin. If you experience any issues changing the message, please post in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/change-password-protected-message) and we can help find a solution that will work on your site.
