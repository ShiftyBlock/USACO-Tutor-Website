= Key Benefits: =

* Show you're trustworthy: Pass our security tests to display the TrustedSite trustmark, which lets visitors know your site is one of the good guys.

* Get repeat business: Shopper Identity Protection covers your customers in the event of identity theft, giving them a reason to come back again.

= How it works =

The TrustedSite certification ensures your customers can trust your site and your business. We begin by checking your site for security issues and verifying key contact information so we know your site is secure and your business is legitimate.

Once you've passed our security scan, your site begins displaying the TrustedSite floating trustmark for up to 500 visits per month at no charge.

When your visitors click on the trustmark, we'll show them an on-site modal available in 20 languages. It shows the secure status of your website. Additionally, we'll show you are a Verified Business by independently verifying your key contact information and displaying it on your verification modal—proving that your business is legitimate, reliable, and can be trusted.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the trustmarks? =

The TrustedSite certification and trustmarks are designed to build trust in a merchant's reliability and the safety of personal data. The suite of trustmarks are designed to increase confidence when it matters most. The trustmarks let website visitors know that a website has been tested and certified to meet our security standards. When a website is certified, it can display the trustmark. When it no longer meets our standards, the trustmark vanishes until the standards are met.

= Will the TrustedSite trustmarks work with other Security plugins I have on my site? =

Yes. Often we require certified sites to have multiple layers of security including SSL certificates and perimeter and behind the firewall vulnerability scanning. In many cases, a website will have several security services in place along with TrustedSite certification.

= What do you get with the free version of TrustedSite certification? =

Once your site is certified, the TrustedSite floating trustmark will display on your website, which lets your customers know the site they’re on is part of the SECURE web. With the free service, the trust mark will display for the first 500 visits each month. After your site reaches the 500 visit limit, the trustmark will not be displayed for the remainder of the month. The trustmark will reappear at the beginning of the following month and your visit count will start over at zero.

= How do you define 500 visits? =

We define “visits” as anyone who engages in a session on your site at some point during the month. The session cookie is set for 24 hours. This means that the visitor needs to be idle for more than 24 hours to be counted as a “visitor” for a second time. At the beginning of each month, the visit count will start back at 0. Each time you login to your account at trustedsite.com, you’ll be able to see how many visitors have seen the trustmark so far for the given month.

= How do I upgrade to a Pro plan? =

Upgrading is easy! When you upgrade, your trustmark code stays exactly the same. Login to your account and you’ll have to option to upgrade to Pro. Once you select this option, you can make your first payment and set everything up in just a few minutes. (Note: you will need to add additional snippets of code to your site in order to install the additional trustmarks. Don’t worry: there are easy-to-follow directions on how to do this once you have completed the upgrade.)

= How does pricing for TrustedSite Certification Pro work? =

TrustedSite Certification pricing is based on usage and how many visits your site gets each month.
