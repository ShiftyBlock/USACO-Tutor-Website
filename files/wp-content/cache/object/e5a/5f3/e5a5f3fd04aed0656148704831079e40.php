Our policy lasts 30 days, or 48 hours after the first class, whichever comes first. If this has gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we canâ€™t offer you a refund.&nbsp;

After 48 hours after the first class, we can offer a 75% course credit to be applied to any other course.

Refunds (if applicable)

Once you have notified us of the refund, we will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days. Note that all refunds are subject to a 3% fee, levied by the Credit Card Provider. We cannot do anything about this. Course credit does not have fees.

Late or missing refunds (if applicable)

If you havenâ€™t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.
Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.
Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.

If youâ€™ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at&nbsp;refund@usacotutor.com.

Sale items (if applicable)

If you have applied a coupon to your purchase, you will be refunded the amount you originally paid for it.";s:10:"post_title";s:13:"Refund Policy";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:6:"refund";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2020-11-08 06:12:31";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2020-11-08 06:12:31";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://usacotutor.com/?page_id=587";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
