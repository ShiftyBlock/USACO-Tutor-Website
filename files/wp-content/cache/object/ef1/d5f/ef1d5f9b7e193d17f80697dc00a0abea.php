After I read this Quora Answer, I was definitely really thinking about what Brinning said about the reasons to graduate early with an Associates Degree, and how this related to me, for not only the AS degree but also high school graduation.

The first reason that Brinning stated for using the AS degree to redeem 2 years really shocked me.&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<h6>Do you plan to reduce the time you are in college?</h6>
If so, I don't like the reasoning. My opinion is that college is a time for you to figure out who you really are. It is a time to babystep into being an adult. It is meant to give you the opportunity to try new things, in a new environment, in a way that isn't supposed to cause permanent damage.

Let's take that apart. Firstly, this is geared towards college students. The issue right now is HS early graduation. So the point of baby-stepping into being an adult is definitely more prominent here. Moreover, I'm "just" in high school. So, if this advice is geared towards college students, why is this even applicable to me? It's obviously not supposed to have been. High School should be an even better opportunity to "try new things" in a way that doesn't cause significant damage, over college. College charges you 50k a year, but high school is free.&nbsp;I mean, to be fair, I'm not really trying anything new in high school. But this does go back to the "lose childhood" point and having to step away from the sandbox and into the "real world".

Wait, why do I want to graduate early? Uhhhhhhhh, category 1, again. Just taking the classes I have to do.

I suppose that the difference would be that college has cool classes and overseas programs, but high school has USACO. That's pretty cool.

&nbsp;Anyways, that's the first point that Brinning made about graduating early in the sense of an Associate's Degree. Brinning highly disapproves of this reasoning of reducing time for the sake of reducing time. Here's a quote from Jenny, my college counselor.&nbsp;
<blockquote>
				One note: you debating this hard does showcase that you have something to hang on to. My sister had the choice to skip 8th grade and move directly to high school. She didnâ€™t have to think much cuz she didnâ€™t have much to lose staying in middle school longer.
Other note: you have 4 years of college, and 60 years in the workforce.

The part about not having much to lose, I would disagree with? Running the numbers, graduating early by 3 years increases earnings by 5%. A pretty lame constant factor, honestly. Okay actually, never mind. 5% sucks. You can make 5% on your lifetime earnings every year you retire.&nbsp;

I think that graduating early for you carries an irrational sense of happiness for you. Being able to say that you're 3 years ahead academically is pretty cool, especially if you do decide to pursue high education, maybe an MBA or JD. Phd is too hard lol.&nbsp;

3 years is a lot of time, too. Well, at least 3 years felt like a lot of time when my parents were away working on their own startup. And it's doing okay in COVID. So I think this is just a testament of how much 3 years really is.&nbsp;

3 Years is more than 1000 days. Can you even fathom 1095? For starters, 1095 is as big as my school. If everyday we removed 1 student from school every day, that's how many days I can save. Well, the analogy sucked, and I guess you can also transpose the analogy into "if you remove 1 person every day, you won't notice them gone until the last days", which is actually also very true. But not the point.

All in all, the 3 Year thing seems interesting. From the perspective of someone who has worked for 40 years, 3 years is nothing. They didn't even realize it went away. And for the average college student, 3 years is almost their entire degree. It's more than 10% of their total life. And honestly, I don't even know what to extrapolate from this. Maybe it's that our sense of time slows down in our 30s-60s. Maybe people all follow a schedule of work for 30 years or until they can't do it anymore. Maybe I'm too naive to understand how small 3 years is, or they're too old to understand how big 3 years is. Probably a combination of all of them.

Graduating early from High School has like... sooooo many cons attached to it. Let's break them down: USACO, USACO, USACO. Oh, wait. Just 3. They're all equal.

The first point, USACO. It's the programming competition I do, all of my friends at this point know that this is the only thing I do outside of school work and wasting time. I'm currently like top 1000 in HS because people keep their ranks every year (ie: 200+/y) Well, hopefully I can prove that I am actually in Platinum soon.

Anyways, back to USACO.

Oh wait, I'm still talking about it. My bad.

The first point I wanted to make about USACO is that it's my only defining factor. If someone were to ask "what defines you as a person", it would be boring, dull, and USACO. In the current world of University Applications, students like me: the stereotypical STEM Asian Male; enjoy some differentiation. Sorry e<sup>x</sup>.

Oh, oops, did I imply that I'm doing USACO for University Applications? Hell no. I enjoy solving problems more than boring Uni Apps, plus, USACO is kind of the worst way to differentiate yourself. Worst ROI ever. LOL.

Second point. The unknown of what's after USACO. Usually, the only people who ask this kind of question are the people who are already successful. But in every game, there's going to be losers. Like me. The winners can go off and land lucrative 300k+/y jobs right after university. Or become an Interview Prep Influencer. Or start up a billion dollar company. But I'm not a winner.

So what <em>do</em> the losers do?

Last point. USACO. Again. My desire to be a "winner". I mean, coming so far from March 2020, you've always positioned yourself as&nbsp;<del>the center of the universe</del> a winner. You talked to people like you already won. Like you were good. And then you go and do a problem and then your facade is shattered. And this pre-winner mindset doesn't just hurt your productivity on a one time basis, it's there, forever. Even right now, I position myself as a winner in conversations about USACO.&nbsp;

Ok, so is it arrogance? Is it self-deprecation? Well, actually the community is to blame, a little. They keep pretending they're bad. Even with your real life friend, I mean, after your friend only practiced an hour a day and you practiced 3 hours a day since March, and he is now better than you, that wasn't too fun.&nbsp;

Ok, well that was a pro and con discussion on what would happen if I graduate high school early. Not very fun. Lots of mixed feelings: nostalgia from March, sadness, disappointment, annoyance. There were also some happy emotions, but mostly negative ones, especially when writing the cons section.&nbsp;

Honestly, I've been discussing this with myself for like... forever. Jenny is probably tired of you too. IDK. Just fucking deal with it dude.&nbsp;

Firstly, you are GOING to tell your parents, because at the very least you have the option to chicken out and stay for another year. Secondly, at this point, I feel like your self arguments with staying another year are kind of meaningless. What on earth are you even accomplishing?&nbsp;

Oh.&nbsp;

Right.&nbsp;

NOT practicing, idiot.

Overall, please, just stop thinking about this. Please move on. And please think carefully about the cost of graduating early.&nbsp;";s:10:"post_title";s:20:"Regarding B.S. at 18";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:18:"regarding-bs-at-18";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2020-11-21 10:03:25";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2020-11-21 10:03:25";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:29:"https://usacotutor.com/?p=814";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
